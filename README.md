Starktopia is a turn-based strategy game. Set on hexagonal tiles, it emphasizes resource management and strategic city customization. Players must control scarce resources and decide whether to trade, form alliances, or engage in conflict to secure them. A rare meta-resource persists beyond individual matches, unlocking new content and opportunities. With an expanded tech tree and more customization options, Starktopia challenges players to adapt their tactics in a dynamic environment.
